Question 21
Question:
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0).
The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps.
The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:

UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2

The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute
the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point.
If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
Example: If the following tuples are given as input to the program:

UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2

Then, the output of the program should be:

2

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
Here distance indicates to euclidean distance.Import math module to use sqrt function.
