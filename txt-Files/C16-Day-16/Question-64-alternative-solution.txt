Question 64
Question
Please write a program using generator to print the numbers
which can be divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n
in comma separated form while n is input by console.

Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:

100

Then, the output of the program should be:

0,35,70

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Hints
Use yield to produce the next value in generator.
