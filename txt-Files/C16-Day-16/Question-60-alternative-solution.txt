Question 60
Question
Write a program to compute:

f(n)=f(n-1)+100 when n>0
and f(0)=0

with a given n input by console (n>0).

Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:

5

Then, the output of the program should be:

500

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Hints
We can define recursive function in Python.

n = int(input())

f = lambda x: f(x - 1) + 100 if x > 0 else 0

print(f(n))
