Question 11
Question
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers
as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not.
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

Example:

0100,0011,1010,1001

Then the output should be:

1010

Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

    # it will be converted to decimal
    return int(x,2) % 5 == 0

# in filter(func,object) function, elements are picked from 'data'
# if found True by 'check' function
