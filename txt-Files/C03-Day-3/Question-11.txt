Question 11
Question
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers
as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not.
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

Example:

0100,0011,1010,1001

Then the output should be:

1010

Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# converts binary to integer & returns zero if divisible by 5
def check(x):
    total, pw = 0, 1
    reversed(x)

    # ord() function returns ASCII value
    for i in x:
        total += pw * (ord(i) - 48)
        pw *= 2
    return total % 5

# inputs taken here and splitted in ',' position
data = input().split(",")
lst = []

# if zero found it means divisible by zero and added to the list
for i in data:
    if check(i) == 0:
        lst.append(i)
